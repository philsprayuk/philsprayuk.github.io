title: Phil Spray, Content Designer
---
<h1>Hi there, I'm Phil 👋🏻</h1>
<p>I'm a content designer with lots of experience working on websites, emails, and other types of communication for large and small organisations.</p>
<p>My background in journalism and communications helps me to get into the mind of the user or reader.</p>
<p>Most of my work has been in the public sector or similar types of organisations.</p>
<p>I live in Berkshire with my family. I like walking, reading, and the odd pint of locally brewed beer.</p>
<p> This website is a <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimum viable product</a>. I plan to iterate over time. (If I ever get time!)
