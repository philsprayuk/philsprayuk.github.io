title: Phil Spray, Content Designer

<h1>Hi there, I'm Phil 👋🏻</h1>
<p>I'm a content designer from Reading, UK.</p>
<p>I have experience working on websites, emails, social media, and other communications for large and small organisations.</p>
<p>I’m married with 3 children and I like walking, reading, and the odd pint of locally brewed beer.</p>
<p> This website is a <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimum viable product</a>. I plan to iterate over time. (If I ever get time!)
