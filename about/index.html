<h1>About</h1>
<p>I am currently a Senior Content Designer at Transform UK. In this role, Iâ€™ve been developing user centred content for the Department for Education.</p>

<p>Before that, I was Digital Content Designer with Thames Water, the largest water company in the UK. I worked on introducing user testing for website content, as well as playing a central role in moving to a new content management platform.</p>

<p>I also worked for Nominet, the registry for .uk domain names, where I worked on a number of projects including the launch of the new domains for Wales, .wales and .cymru. I also played a key role in the development of an online safety advice website.</p>

<p>My first communications role was at West Berkshire Council. This was a great opportunity to learn about the wide range of different council services, from bin collections to historic tourist attractions. During my time there, I worked on a number of important projects including the creation of the first email newsletter.</p>
