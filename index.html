title: Phil Spray, Content Designer

<h1>Hi there, I'm Phil 👋🏻</h1>
<p>I'm a content designer from Reading, UK.</p>
<p>I have experience working on websites, emails, social media, and other communications for large and small organisations.</p>
<p>I’m married with 3 children and I like walking, reading, and the odd pint of locally brewed beer.</p>
<p> This website is a <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/minimum-viable-product-mvp-and-design-balancing-risk-to-gain-reward">minimum viable product</a>, which I aim to iterate over time. (If I ever get time!)
